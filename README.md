# sample_model_examples_tensorboard
Some sample models examples used for giving brief idea about the project.
Basically these are some sample models which are work like base models for my project regarding TensorBoard in GSOC 2019.
Here are some basic models which whose performance analysis can be done on tensorboard easily . Also we can debug them by tracing 
some existing errors present in them. This is purely for the purpose of GSoc 2019 proposal.
